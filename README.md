# HeartR8
Proof of conecpt of an IoT system designed on three layers: embedded board, edge device, cloud. The **embedded board** generates hard coded integer values (representing heart beats per minute) and send them to an **Android application** developed in _Kotlin_ that redirects them to the **Cloud** using _Amazon Web Services_. AWS takes on the role of reading the data and plotting them on a graph.
